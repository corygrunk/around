### Quick start
1. Play audio through your norns. 
2. Press K2 to start recording the loop. 
3. K2 again starts looping and starts up the extra playheads.
4. E1 cycles through the loops.
5. When the main loop is selected, E2/E3 adjusts start and end point.
6. When a micro-loop is selected, E2 moves it. E3 resizes it.
7. Hold Alt and you can make more changes to the loops.
8. K2 toggles overdub.
9. K3 resets everything including deleting the main loop.
